# weather-APP
This project is a web application that allows users to check the weather for a specific city. It consists of a server-side Java component (a Servlet) and a client-side HTML/CSS/JavaScript interface. The Servlet handles HTTP requests and responses, redirects users to a landing page, and fetches weather data from the OpenWeatherMap API. It then parses and displays weather details on a result page ("index.jsp"). The client-side interface includes input fields for users to enter a city name, and it dynamically displays weather information along with weather icons based on the current conditions. CSS is used for styling, and various weather-related images are included for visual representation. Overall, the application provides a user-friendly way to access and view weather data for a chosen city.
